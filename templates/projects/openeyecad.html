			<span style="font-weight:400;">Problem Statement: </span>An online repositories of 3D models exist, but customization and accessibility modify them is nonexistent. Files can be modified only by a proficient coder or a designer. For a normal person in the medical profession, there is no provision for customizing things. Hence the accessibility and use of something as efficient as 3D printing is a segment doctors still don’t touch.
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:400;">Solution: </span> Doctors and users can modify the models by changing just some parameters. The entire programming happens in the background. The modified rendered image can be viewed and the STL file generated, then and there itself. 5 years down the line, when 3D printers are going to be a household name, this platform will revolutionize accessibility, be cost effective and tackle sterility as well.

			<span style="font-weight:400;">GROUND UP &amp; CO-INNOVATION: </span> 

			We have built a platform that brings together technical experts, innovators, academic institutions, implementation partners and progressive corporate partners that will allow us to solve the most pressing challenges within India, and other developing countries. The focus is on finding solutions that help serve the "The Next 5 Billion" citizens by:

			Identifying community specific challenges that may have solutions that could also be applied to multiple locations.
			Providing mentorship, training and technical support from corporate partners, MIT and other leading institutions to assist innovators creating novel technical solutions for rapidly emerging and pop-up cities.
			Pairing innovators with implementation partners on the ground to ensure that each product responds to real needs and enters the market with speed and scale.

		<h5>Future Work</h5>
		<hr>
		<p class="flow-text" style="font-size:18px;">
			Currently we have made a basic web repository with just a couple of models and a tutorial to start with. Each and every model of
			any device that can be 3D printed needs to be coded and then corresponding variables be introduced as parameters so that any
			change by the user modifies and generates the rendered image all in the background. Hence, the code for models need to be
			developed with open source participation from as many people around the world as possible.
			Development of a software with an existing CAD platform to automatically generate parametric code is one prime target.
